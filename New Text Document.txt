Look at the speaker directly. Put aside distracting thoughts and objects like phone. Lakshshouldput away his mobile and give Surya his full attention. Hemust respond with verbal and non-verbal nods and interact with Surya to ensurethat he is listening actively.



Clue for case 2: Paul seems to be upset. Suresh shouldhave been alerted with the tone of Paul’s voice and paid closer attention towhat he was saying. Instead, Suresh seemed to be preoccupied (probably working on something else or was in a very casual mindset at the time)Suresh seems to use empathy while responding. He cannot empathize without truly understanding the problemSuresh says he understands the problembut then asks for it to be explained in detail, projecting that he did not entirely understand what the problem was.



1. A fellow team member just made a presentation on Social Media. However, the presentation didn't have enough information and examples on the topic discussed.
You want to add more details to the presentation on whether social media is a boon or bane, usage of social media for various purposes like marketing, networking etc.
Make appropriate assumptions wherever required.
Do a role play asking probing questions to get more information that you require from team member, who is SME(subject matter expert) in social media.
